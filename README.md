# Hyperlinks

In this lab you will use <a></a> tag to create internal and external links, and bookmarks

## Challenge 1

- [ ] Copy and Paste the following code into the index.html page, 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Hyperlinks</title>
</head>
<body>
<div id="nav">
<!--Create bookmark links to the sections below-->

</div>
<div id="fav-sites" style="min-height:500px; background-color:lightgray;">
<!--Provide external links to your favorite sites here-->

</div>
<div id="class-work" style="min-height:500px;">
<!--Provide internal links to your previous class work-->

</div>
<div id="about-me" style="min-height:500px; background-color:lightgray;">
<!--provide some fun facts about you-->

</div>
</body>
</html>

```

- [ ] In the <body></body> section of your page, write code to implement the webpage shown here: [WebpageMockup.jpg](WebpageMockup.jpg) 

	* Locate the section indicated with the id = nav.  In between the <div></div> tags create bookmark links to the following sections
		- fav-sites
		- class-work
		- about-me

	* Locate the section indicated with the id = fav-sites.  In between the <div></div> tags provide external links to your favorite sites

	* Locate the section indicated with the id = class-work.  In between the <div></div> tags provide internal links to different assignments for this class.  You will need to move these previous assignment and their files into this directory.  You will also need to rename Index.html pages for each of these assignments to something other than "Index.html".  

	* Locate the section indicated with the id = about-me.  In between the <div></div> tags indicate some fun facts about you. 

## Challenge 2

- [ ] Make your site public by doing the following.  

	* Once you have completed Challenge 2, push your work to GitHub.  
	* Navigate to this repository on GitHub and locate the Settings link
	* Locate the _GitHub Pages_ section and select _master_ from the branch menu, then save. [GitHubScreenshot.jpg](GitHubScreenshot.jpg) 
	* Return to the _GitHub Pages_ section and note the link that was created. [GitHubScreenshot2.jpg](GitHubScreenshot2.jpg).  You will need to wait a bit, but this is the link to your live site!
